# 🧱 Stack – Data Structure

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO** principle (*Last In, First Out*), meaning the last element inserted is the first to be removed.

## ⚙️ Basic Stack Operations

Here are the fundamental operations that can be performed on a stack:

- 🔼 `push()` – Inserts an element into the stack  
- 🔽 `pop()` – Removes the last inserted element  
- 🔍 `top()` – Returns the top element of the stack without removing it  
- ⚪ `isEmpty()` – Returns `true` if the stack is empty, otherwise `false`  
- 📏 `size()` – Returns the current size of the stack

## 🧪 Implemented Methods

In this package, we implemented the following methods to manipulate a stack:

| 🗃️ Data Structure | 🛠️ Available Methods                                                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stack**         | `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `is_empty()`, `size()`, `display()`          |

> 🔁 **Note**: The `peek()` method is equivalent to `top()`, allowing you to view the top element without removing it.
