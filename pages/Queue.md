# 📦 Queue – Data Structure

Like a **Stack**, a **Queue** is also a linear data structure.  
However, it follows the **FIFO** principle (*First In, First Out*), meaning the first element inserted is the first to be removed.

## ⚙️ Basic Queue Operations

Here are the fundamental operations you can perform on a queue:

- ➕ `enqueue()` – Adds an element to the rear of the queue
- ➖ `dequeue()` – Removes the front element of the queue
- 👁️ `peek()` or `front()` – Returns the front element without removing it
- 🔚 `rear()` – Returns the last element without removing it
- 🧱 `isFull()` – Checks whether the queue is full
- ⚪ `isNull()` – Checks whether the queue is empty

## 🧪 Implemented Methods

In this package, we implement the following methods for the Queue data structure:

| 🗃️ Data Structure | 🛠️ Available Methods                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Queue**         | `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `peek()`, `rear()`, `is_empty()`, `display()`                |

> 🔁 **Note**: In our implementation, `is_empty()` is used instead of `isNull()` for consistency with common coding conventions.
